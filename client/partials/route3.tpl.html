CONGTATUALATIONS!! This is route3.tpl.html.<br/>
This route is accessible by users who have user level permissions only.</br>
Here we make a call to route '/needUserLevelInfo' on server side. When you peek in the code you will realize that we protect this call on server too. hence Authentication is happening on both client and server side. </br>
